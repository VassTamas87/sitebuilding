              <p><b>Donald Trump</b>, in full <b>Donald John Trump</b>,<br>
                (born June 14, 1946, New York, New York, U.S.), 45th president<br>
                of the United States (2017–21). Trump was a real-estate <br> developer
                and businessman who owned, managed,<br> or licensed his
                name to several hotels, casinos, golf courses, resorts, and <br>
                residential properties in the New York City area and<br>
                around the world. From the 1980s Trump also lent his name to<br>
                scores of retail ventures—including branded lines of<br>
                clothing, cologne, food, and furniture—and to Trump University,
                <br>
                which offered seminars in real-estate education<br>
                from 2005 to 2010. In the early 21st century his private <br>
                conglomerate, the Trump Organization, comprised some 500<br>
                companies involved in a wide range of businesses, including <br>
                hotels and resorts, residential properties,<br>
                merchandise, and entertainment and television. Trump was the
                <br>
                third president in U.S. history (after Andrew Johnson<br>
                in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998) to be impeached<br> by the U.S.
                House of Representatives and the only president to<br>
                be impeached twice—once (in 2019) for abuse of power <br>
                and obstruction of Congress in connection with the Ukraine<br>
                scandal and once (in 2021) for “incitement of insurrection” <br>
                in connection with the storming of the United States<br>
                Capitol by a violent mob of Trump supporters as Congress met
                <br>
                in joint session to ceremonially count electoral<br>
                college votes from the 2020 presidential election. Both of <br>
                Trump’s impeachments ended in his acquittal by the U.S.<br>
                Senate. Trump lost the 2020 election to former vice president
                <br>
                Joe Biden by 306 electoral votes to 232; he lost the<br>
                popular vote by more than seven million votes.</p>
