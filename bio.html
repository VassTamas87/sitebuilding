      <p><b>Donald Trump</b>, in full <b>Donald John Trump</b>,
        (born June 14, 1946, New York, New York, U.S.), 45th president
        of the United States (2017–21). Trump was a real-estate
        developer
        and businessman who owned, managed, or licensed his
        name to several hotels, casinos, golf courses, resorts, and
        residential properties in the New York City area and
        around the world. From the 1980s Trump also lent his name to
        scores of retail ventures—including branded lines of
        clothing, cologne, food, and furniture—and to Trump University,
        which offered seminars in real-estate education
        from 2005 to 2010. In the early 21st century his private
        conglomerate, the Trump Organization, comprised some 500
        companies involved in a wide range of businesses, including
        hotels and resorts, residential properties,
        merchandise, and entertainment and television. Trump was the
        third president in U.S. history (after Andrew Johnson
        in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998) to be impeached by the
        U.S.
        House of Representatives and the only president to
        be impeached twice—once (in 2019) for abuse of power
        and obstruction of Congress in connection with the Ukraine
        scandal and once (in 2021) for “incitement of insurrection”
        in connection with the storming of the United States
        Capitol by a violent mob of Trump supporters as Congress met

        in joint session to ceremonially count electoral
        college votes from the 2020 presidential election. Both of
        Trump’s impeachments ended in his acquittal by the U.S.
        Senate. Trump lost the 2020 election to former vice president
        Joe Biden by 306 electoral votes to 232; he lost the
        popular vote by more than seven million votes.
